Stream Benchmark

Uses the STREAM benchmark and stream-scaling automation scripts to measure 
memory performance. STREAM is a simple synthetic benchmark program that 
measures sustainable memory bandwidth. The STREAM benchmark consists of four 
tests:

Copy -  measures transfer rates in the absence of arithmetic
Scale - adds a simple arithmetic operation
Add -   adds a third operand to allow multiple load/store ports on vector 
        machines to be tested
Triad - allows chained/overlapped/fused multiply/add operations

stream-scaling detects the number of CPUs in the system and how large each of 
their caches are. It then downloads STREAM, compiles it, and runs it with an 
array size large enough to not fit into cache. The number of threads is varied 
from 1 to the total number of cores in the server, so that you can see how 
memory speed scales as cores involved increase.


GNUPLOT
A gnuplot graph will be generated for threaded triad results if gnuplot is 
installed. This graphs will be named triad-graph.png and created in each 
benchmark iteration directory.
